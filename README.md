# Sports_Cars_Efficiency
A simple tidy and analysis exercise of Sports Cars and their respective efficiencies.

## Introduction:
Sources: This data was retrieved from Kaggle.com. The link for this data is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/sports-car-prices-dataset?resource=download.

Goal: Compare the "efficiencies" of sports cars in a small dataset. I have defined efficiency in this context to mean each engine’s horsepower per liter and 0–60 time per liter. I intentionally exclude torque because it may introduce bias: horsepower already incorporates torque (HP = torque * RPM / 5252), so adding torque per liter would amount to double-counting the same underlying measurement.
